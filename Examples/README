C++ example programs to illustrate Statismo's basic functionality and how it can be used together with ITK or VTK. 

Compiling the examples:
-----------------------
The examples are built if the option BUILD_{ITK,VTK}_EXAMPLES is enabled for your build.

Example data
------------
Statismo comes with simple 2D example datasets (2D images, deformation fields and contours of hands), which can be used to try out the example programs. 

More interesting 3D example data (Face scans and Femur images) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/downloads/statismo/statismo/statismo-data.zip).

Visualization of the results
----------------------------
Shape models are most easily visualized using the [Statismo model viewer](https://github.com/statismo/statismo/wiki/Statismo%20Viewer). To visualize the image or deformation models, we suggest to draw samples from the model and visualize these with [paraview](http://www.paraview.org]
